## Highlights
- If you pick stocks, you MUST learn how to read a balance sheet.
  Here’s everything you need to know: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFeroldi/status/1566382865503453185))
- The balance sheet is one of the 3 major financial statements. 
  It shows: 
  ▪️Assets: What a company owns
  ▪️Liabilities: What a company owes
  ▪️Shareholders Equity: The net worth attributable to its owners (shareholders)
  At a fixed point in time

- That “at a fixed point in time” part is key!
  A balance sheet is a SNAPSHOT of a company’s net worth at a POINT in time, usually measured at the end of a quarter/year.
  That differs from an income statement or cash flow statement, both of which are measured over a PERIOD of time

- Most public companies show their balance sheet in their quarterly earnings press release, but not always
  Find them by looking at:
  ▪️10-Q (quarterly report) 
  ▪️10-K (annual report)
  ▪️Aggregator websites like @theTIKR

- All balance sheets follow the same formula:
  Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders Equity
  This formula must be in balance at all times
  (Hence the term “balance sheet”)

  This graphic shows some of the most commonly used categories & terms

- Let’s start with assets, which is what a company OWNS
  Assets are listed in order of LIQUIDITY, which means how quickly a security can be turned into cash
  The most liquid assets are at the top, the least liquid on the bottom

- There are two categories of assets:
  Current assets:
  ▪️Assets that are expected to be used in <1 year
  Long-term assets:
  ▪️Assets that a company will benefit from for >1 year

- Now for Liabilities, which are what a company OWES

- Finally, there is "Shareholders Equity

  It's kind of like a company's "net worth"

  ▪️Additional Paid-In Capital: Amount shareholders have invested beyond common/preferred stock
  ▪️Retained Earnings: Net profits a company reinvests in the business
  ▪️Treasury Stock: Money used to buy back stock ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFeroldi/status/1566382879856361483))
- Here's an example of a real balance sheet
  This is taken from $HD's balance sheet as of July 31st, 2022 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FbzlSinWIAIopcK.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFeroldi/status/1566382880904855554))
- Notice that $HD's Shareholder Equity is really low?
  Don't worry -- that's just because of the company's massive stock buyback program ($84.5 billion spent so far)
  Treasure stock is listed as a negative number in shareholder's equity
