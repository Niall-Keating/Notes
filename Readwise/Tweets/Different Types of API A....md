- API architecture refers to the design of an API and how it is organized. 
  It encompasses the structure of an API and how it is built, including the endpoints, methods, and parameters. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1572254545304080384))
- There are a few different types of API architectures that developers can use to create APIs.
  The most popular type of API architecture is the REST API.
  Other popular types of API architectures include SOAP, XML-RPC, and JSON-RPC. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1572254549548703749))
- 1. REST
  A REST (Restful) API is a web service that uses HTTP requests (GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to manipulate data. 
  A REST API can access resources such as HTML pages, images, and other resources identified by a URL. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1572254553877127173))
- 2. SOAP
  SOAP API refers to the application programming interface for communication in Simple Object Access Protocol. 
  It defines the rules and standards for how two applications can interact with each other over the internet. 
  This type of API is often used in web services. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1572254558046363648))
- 3. RPC
  RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call Application Programming Interface.
  It is a platform-independent communications protocol that allows different software components to communicate with each other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1572254562228097024))
- RPC API is based on the concept of remote procedure calls, which allows a program to execute a procedure or function on a remote machine as if it were local.
  Let's show the two most famous examples. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1572254566548127744))
- 3.1 XML-RPC 
  XML-RPC is a remote procedure call system that uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism. 
  It is designed to be simple and extensible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1572254570725707779))
- 3.2 JSON-RPC
  JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON. 
  It is a simple and lightweight protocol that allows for accessible communication between computers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1572254574961893377))
