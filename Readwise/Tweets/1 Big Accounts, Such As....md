## Highlights
- /1 Big accounts, such as Nike, Procter & Gamble & Nintendo, often cause hotspot issues for the payment system.
  A hotspot payment account is an account that has a large number of concurrent operations on it.

- /2 For example, when merchant A starts a promotion on Amazon Prime day, it receives many concurrent purchasing orders. In this case, the merchantâ€™s account in the database becomes a hotspot account due to frequent updates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1564279744413110272))
- /3 In normal operations, we put a row lock on the merchantâ€™s balance when it gets updated. However, this locking mechanism leads to low throughput and becomes a system bottleneck.
  The diagram below shows several optimizations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1564279746946428928))
- /4 ðŸ”¹Rate limit
  We can limit the number of requests within a certain period. The remaining requests will be rejected or retried at a later time. It is a simple way to increase the systemâ€™s responsiveness for some users, but this can lead to a bad user experience.

- /5 ðŸ”¹Split the balance account into sub-accounts
  We can set up sub-accounts for the merchantâ€™s account. In this way, one update request only locks one sub-account, and the rest sub-accounts are still available.

- /6 ðŸ”¹Use cache to update balance first
  We can set up a caching layer to update the merchantâ€™s balance. The detailed statements and balances are updated in the database later asynchronously. The in-memory cache can deal with much higher throughput than the database.

- /7 Over to you: We can also put the requests into a message queue so the requests can be processed at the serviceâ€™s own pace. Can you think of the limitations of this approach? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1564279790143561728))
