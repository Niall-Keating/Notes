## Highlights
- Linux vs GNU/Linux vs Alpine Linux üßµ
  1. Linux is the kernel. What Linus wrote in the 90th. That's it.
  Interesting fact: Excluding drivers, the kernel itself is just a few megabytes when compiled. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1560977903227383810))
- 2. GNU is a large collection of free software which can be used as an operating system (or in parts with other operating systems).
  You, of course, know this software very well: grep, sed, gcc, the list goes on.
  GNU includes the C standard library implementation called glibc üî• ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1560977904988835842))
- 3. GNU/Linux is any Linux distro (kernel + userland) based on the GNU collection.
  Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and even RHEL are technically GNU/Linux.
  Because of the common C stdlib and system tools, often you can jump between GNU/Linux distros w/o much trouble ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1560977906628706305))
- 4. Alpine Linux is an alternative Linux distro, not based on the GNU collection.
  Instead of GNU, Alpine uses:
  - BusyBox: a tiny software suite (~2MB) that provides several Unix utilities in a single executable file.
  - musl: a modern and more robust C stdlib implementation üî• ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1560977908793065475))
- 5. Alpine Linux is not a drop-in replacement for GNU/Linux distros like Debian or CentOS!
  musl's behavior may differ from glibc ‚ÄºÔ∏è
  You don't write code in C? It doesn't matter! Unless you use Go, your lang's runtime most likely heavily utilizes the C stdlib provided by the OS. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1560977910454001669))
