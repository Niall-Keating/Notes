## Highlights
- If you pick stocks, you MUST learn how to read an income statement.
  Here’s everything you need to know: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFeroldi/status/1563863961283477506))
- The income statement shows a company’s revenue and expenses over a period of time, usually a quarter or year. 
  It’s also called:
  ▪️Profit and Loss statement, or “P & L”
  ▪️Statement of earnings
  It follows this basic format:

- Most public companies show their income statement in their quarterly earnings press release, but not always
  Find them by looking at:
  ▪️10-Q (quarterly report) 
  ▪️10-K (annual report)
  ▪️Aggregator websites like @theTIKR

- The income statement flows in a step-down manner.
  The top number is revenue (sales), and costs + expenses are subtracted as you go down

- Let's take them one at a time
  1: Revenue
  This is the net amount received from the sales of products/services to customers
  Sales are NET, meaning it includes discounts, returns, and any other deductions.

- 2: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
  This figure shows all of the costs related to producing the product and/or service
  It's also called "cost of sales"

- 3: Gross profit
  Also called “gross income”
  This assesses a company's efficiency at using its labor and supplies in producing goods or services
  This is a VERY important number

- 4: Operating Expenses (OPEX)
  A catchall category that includes all expenses to run a company’s day-to-day operations
  Some companies break them out by category. Others lump them all together.

- 5: Operating Income
  Gross Profit - OPEX
  This shows how much profit a company earned from its ongoing operations
  It can also be called “EBIT”

- 6: Non-Operating Income/Expense
  Revenue or expenses incurred unrelated to running the business
  The biggest number is usually interest on debt or gain/loss on the sale of an asset

- 7: Pre-tax income
  Operating Income 
  +/- 
  Non-Operating Income/Expenses
  Also called “EBT” or “Earnings Before Tax”

  Taxes paid to federal, state, and local governments

- 9: Net income
  We made it to “the bottom line”, aka “earnings” or “profits” 
  If this number is positive, the business is "profitable"
  If it's negative, the business is "unprofitable"

- 10a: Time to divide the profits!
  There are 2 ways to report "earnings per share"
  1) Divide by "basic shares," which is the total number of shares of common stock currently outstanding

- 10a: 
  2) Divide by "diluted" shares, which is the total number of shares that could be outstanding including stock-based compensation + convertible debt

- A helpful exercise is to divide each figure by sales, giving us "margins"
  Doing so allows you to compare companies of different sizes to each other and track profit direction
  My favorites:
  ▪️Gross Margin
  ▪️Operating Margin
  ▪️Net Margin
