- 2/ A friend recently went through the irksome experience of being signed out from a number of websites they use daily. This event will be familiar to millions of web users, and it is a tedious process to fix. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1523691177274339328))
- 3/ It can involve trying to remember multiple long-forgotten passwords, or typing in the names of pets from childhood to answer security questions. SSO removes this inconvenience and makes life online better. But how does it work? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1523691180034199552))
- 4/ Basically, Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication scheme. It allows a user to log in to different systems using a single ID.

- 5/ Step 1: A user visits Gmail, or any email service. Gmail finds the user is not logged in and so redirects them to the SSO authentication server, which also finds the user is not logged in.

- 6/ As a result, the user is redirected to the SSO login page, where they enter their login credentials. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1523691194227732480))
- 7/ Steps 2-3: The SSO authentication server validates the credentials, creates the global session for the user, and creates a token.

- 8/ Steps 4-7: Gmail validates the token in the SSO authentication server. The authentication server registers the Gmail system, and returns “valid.” Gmail returns the protected resource to the user.
