## Highlights
- /1 Which latency numbers we should know?
  Please note those are not accurate numbers. They are based on some online benchmarks (Jeff Deanâ€™s latency numbers + some other sources).

- /2 ðŸ”¹L1 and L2 caches: 1 ns, 10 ns
  E.g.: They are usually built onto the microprocessor chip. Unless you work with hardware directly, you probably donâ€™t need to worry about them.

- /3 ðŸ”¹RAM access: 100 ns
  E.g.: It takes 100 ns to read data from memory. Redis is an in-memory store, so it takes about 100 ns to read data from Redis
  ðŸ”¹Send 1K bytes over 1 Gbps network: 10 us
  E.g.: It takes around 10 us to send 1KB of data from Memcached through the network

- /4 ðŸ”¹Read from SSD: 100 us
  E.g.: RocksDB is a disk-based K/V store, so the read latency is around 100 us on SSD.

- /5 ðŸ”¹Database insert operation: 1 ms.
  E.g.: Postgresql insertion might take 1ms. The database needs to store the data, create the index, and flush logs. All these actions take time.

- /6 ðŸ”¹Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA: 100 ms
  E.g.: If we have a long-distance Zoom call, the latency might be around 100 ms.

- /7 ðŸ”¹Retry/refresh internal: 1-10s
  E.g: In a monitoring system, the refresh interval is usually set to 5~10 seconds (default value on Grafana).
  Notes
  -----
  1 ns = 10^-9 seconds
  1 us = 10^-6 seconds = 1,000 ns
  1 ms = 10^-3 seconds = 1,000 us = 1,000,000 ns

- /8 Over to you - 1). Do you know all ðŸ˜Š?
  2). Nowadays, disk and tape are used as data backup. Do you know which one has a higher write speed?

- The goal of the diagram is not to get the numbers accurate, but to get a general sense of what is slow and fast, in relative terms. We hope the numbers are within the 1 order of magnitude error range. Let me know if you spot an error! I'll correct it. Thank you.
