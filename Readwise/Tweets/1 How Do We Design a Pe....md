- 2/ 1. ACL (Access Control List)
  ACL is a list of rules that specifies which users are granted or denied access to a particular resource.
  Pros - Easy to understand.
  Cons - error-prone, maintenance cost is high ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1570077282479505410))
- 3/ 2. DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
  It grants or restricts object access via an access policy determined by an object's owner group.
  Pros - Easy and flexible. Linux file system supports DAC.
  Cons - Scattered permission control, too much power for the objectâ€™s owner group ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1570077285201616897))
- 4/ 3. MAC (Mandatory Access Control)
  Both resource owners and resources have classification labels. Different labels are granted with different permissions.
  Pros - strict and straightforward.
  Cons - not flexible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1570077288032796672))
- 5/ 4. ABAC (Attribute-based access control)
  Evaluate permissions based on attributes of the Resource owner, Action, Resource, and Environment.
  Pros - flexible
  Cons - the rules can be complicated, and the implementation is hard. It is not commonly used. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1570077290796843008))
- 6/ 5. RBAC (Role-based Access Control)
  Evaluate permissions based on roles
  Pros - flexible in assigning roles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1570077293472784384))
