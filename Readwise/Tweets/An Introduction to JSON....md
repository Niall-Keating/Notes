- JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standard that defines a way of securely transmitting data as JSON objects between parties. 
  JWTs can be used as a method of securing API data. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1570400262937878539))
- A JWT is essentially a string made of three parts. Once decoded, you get two JSON strings that contain the three components of a JWT:
  1. Header and Payload
  2. Signature ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1570400267056594949))
- Data exchanged by JWTs is secure because of their digital signature using either a secret or a private key.
  The receiver of the JWT verifies the signature to ensure the token hasn't been altered after the issuer signs it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1570400271334776832))
- üìå Function of JWTs
  Their primary purpose is user-level authentication and authorization in data exchange.
  Once a user logs in with their credentials, a JWT is returned and sent with every further request. JWTs are commonly used in Single Sign-on features. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1570400275436896257))
- JWT structure and their ability to be signed ensures that the senders can be securely verified and content remains unaltered.
  It also means the server is queried only once, and further requests are authenticated using the JWT. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1570400279605944320))
