## Highlights
- What are some of the algorithms we should know before taking system design interviews?
  I put together a list and explained why they are important.

- One thing to keep in mind is that understanding “how those algorithms are used in real-world systems” is generally more important than the implementation details in a system design interview.

- It’s very difficult to rank algorithms by importance objectively. I’m open to suggestions and making adjustments.
  Five-star: Very important. Try to understand how it works and why.
  Three-star: Important to some extent. 
  One-star: Advanced. Good to know for senior candidates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1544346795437764608))
- Over to you: did I miss anything important on the list? Which ones do you know and which you don’t? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1544346798050852865))
