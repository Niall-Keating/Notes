## Highlights
- Do you know how you get paid at work?
  In the US, tech companies usually run payrolls via Automatic Clearing House (𝐀𝐂𝐇).

- ACH handles retail transactions and is part of American retail payment systems. It processes transactions in 𝐛𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬, not in real-time. The diagram below shows how ACH direct deposit works with payrolls. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1552673173212000256))
- 🔹Step 0: Before we can use ACH network, the originator who starts the transactions needs to open an account at a commercial bank because only banks are allowed to initiate ACH transactions directly. The bank is called ODFI (Originating Depository Financial Institution).

- Then the transaction receiver needs to authorize the originator for certain types of transactions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1552673186377895937))
- 🔹Step 1: The originator company originates salary payment transactions. The transactions are sent to a 3rd-party processor like Gusto. The third-party processor helps with ACH-related services like generating ACH files, etc.

- 🔹Step 2: The third-party processor generates ACH files on behalf of the originator. The files are uploaded to an SFTP established by the ODFI. This should be done by the 7 PM cut-off time, as specified by the ODFI bank.

- 🔹Step 3: After normal business hours in the evening, the ODFI bank forwards the ACH files to the ACH operator for clearing and settlement.

- There are two ACH operators, one is the Federal Reserve (FedACH), and the other is EPN (Electronic Payment Network – which is operated by a private company).

- 🔹Step 4: The ACH files are processed around midnight and made available to the receiving bank RDFI (Receiving Depository Financial Institution.)

- 🔹Step 5: The RDFI operates on the receiver’s bank accounts based on the instructions in the ACH files. In our case, the receiver receives $100 from the originator. This is done when the RDFI opens for business at 6 AM the next day.

- ACH is a next-day settlement system. It means transactions sent out by 7 PM on one day will arrive the following morning.
  Since 2018, it’s possible to choose Same Day ACH so funds can be transferred on the same business day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1552673252161437696))
- Over to you: ACH is a US financial network. If you live outside the US, do you know what payment method your employer uses to send payment? What’s the difference between ACH and wire transfer?
