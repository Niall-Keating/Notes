- @GergelyOrosz Startups tend to prioritize moving fast and iterating quickly. As the company attracts users, these teams need to start to find ways to not cause regressions or ship bugs. They then have the choice of going down one of two paths: hire QAs or invest in automation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1532738966180376578))

- @GergelyOrosz While automation is sometimes present in more traditional companies, it's very typical that they rely on large QA teams to verify what they build. Working on branches is also common; it's rare to have trunk-based development in these environments. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1532738976515166208))
