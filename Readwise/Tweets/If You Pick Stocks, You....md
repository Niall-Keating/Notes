- The Cash Flow Statement shows how cash moves in and out of a company over a period of time.
  Its purpose is to track cash movement through a business.
  It's kind of like your checking account statement from your bank.

- The Cash Flow Statement uses CASH accounting.
  This method only records transactions when money goes in or out of an account.
  This differs from ACCRUAL accounting, which is the accounting method used on the Income Statement and Balance Sheet

- There are three main segments to a Cash Flow Statement:
  1. Operating Activities
  2. Investing Activities
  3. Financing Activities
  Companies get some leeway with how they break out each segment, but they all follow this basic structure:

- The Cash Flow statement has tons of nuance, but it's arguably the most important financial statement to master.
  That's especially true in hard economic times (like right now). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFeroldi/status/1568936849414189057))
