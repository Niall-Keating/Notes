  🔹Deposit process: Bob goes to Bank of America (BoA) to open an account and deposit $100. A new account B1234 is created in the wallet system for Bob. The cash goes to the bank’s vault and Bob’s wallet now has $100.

- 3. If Bob wants to use the banking services of Citibank (Citi,) he needs to go through the same process all over again. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1555570923750641666))
- 4. 🔹Transfer process: Bob opens BoA’s App and transfers $50 to Alice’s account at Citi. The amount is deducted from Bob’s account B1234 and credited to Alice’s account C512. The actual movement of cash doesn’t happen instantly.

- 5. It happens after BoA and Citi settle all transactions at end-of-day.
  🔹Withdrawal process: Bob withdraws his remaining $50 from account B1234. The amount is deducted from B1234, and Bob gets the cash.

  🔹Deposit & Withdraw: Blockchains support cryptocurrencies, with no cash involved. Bob needs to generate an address as the transfer recipient and store the private key in a crypto wallet like Metamask. Then Bob can receive cryptocurrencies.

- 7. 🔹Transfer: Bob opens Metamask and enters Alice’s address, and sends it 2 ETHs. Then Bob signs the transaction to authorize the transfer with the private key. When this transaction is confirmed on blockchains, Bob’s address has 8 ETHs and Alice’s address has 101 ETHs.

- 8. 👉 Can you spot the differences?
  Blockchain is distributed ledger. It provides a unified interface to handle the common operations on wallets. Instead of opening multiple accounts with different banks, we just need to open a single account on blockchains, which is the address.

- 9. All transfers are confirmed on blockchains in pseudo real-time, saving us from waiting until end-of-day reconciliations.
  With blockchains, we can merge wallet services from different banks into one global service.
