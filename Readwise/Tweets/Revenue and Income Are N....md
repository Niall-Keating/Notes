- Sales and revenue mean the same thing
  Both are the money that comes in from customer payments
  They both refer to the ‚Äútop line‚Äù of the income statement

- Orders and sales are NOT the same thing
  Orders are when a customer places a request for the future delivery of a product or service
  Orders become sales when the product is actually shipped or service is actually performed ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFeroldi/status/1534892553643905024))
- Costs are different from expenses
  Costs are money spent on making a product or delivering a service (hence "cost of goods sold")
  Expenses are money spent on developing, selling, accounting for, and managing the product or service

- Costs and expenses both become expenditures when money is actually sent to the vendors to pay the bills

- Profits, earnings, and net income all mean the same thing
  They are the ‚Äúbottom line‚Äù of the income statement
  They all represent what is left over after all of the costs & expenses are subtracted from revenue

- Net income and free cash flow are not the same thing
  Net income measures a company‚Äôs profitability on the income statement using accrual accounting
  Free cash flow measures the actual cash flow that is available to shareholders on the cash flow statement using cash accounting

- Accrual accounting and cash accounting are not the same thing
  Accrual accounting: revenue or expenses are recorded when they occur, not when payment is received or made
  Cash accounting: transactions are recorded only when money goes in or out of an account

- Net income is an accountant‚Äôs opinion
  Free cash flow is a fact
  When forced to choose, I'll take free cash flow every time ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFeroldi/status/1534892560380047361))
