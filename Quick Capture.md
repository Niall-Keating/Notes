# Quick Capture

- Don't respond immediately, write it down here...


## Thoughts on overall process in engineering
- As it stands we manufacture hardware in a factory in Shannon and it is often a  nightmare for many reasons
- EVT ssoftware is linux and requires too much configuration, should be able to just have a QR or a single button to click that starts the test and knows everything
- We need something better than a CSV file
	- I think mongodb
		- We can have required keys, ie SN, manu date etc
		- Then an object that can change between devices and contains public key and other device/product specific options
- We need a central serive which allows us to view all of the devices we manufature via a web portal
	- THIs portal should allow
		- Webhook to send to customer
		- Export option for csv, excel etc
		- NOtes section to store notes on device?
		- API to pull out from dms instance
			- or possibly an option to push to an instance
- 
- owners for each sections, 
	- i.e factor


## Things we need
- Branching strategy
- rules to only allow SM's when we have a flow diagram
- Platform IO
- Linux image
- single IDE
- place to store binaries
