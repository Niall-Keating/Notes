# Quick Capture

- Don't respond immediately, write it down here...


## Thoughts on overall process in engineering
- As it stands we manufacture hardware in a factory in Shannon and it is often a  nightmare for many reasons
	- EVT ssoftware is linux and requires too much configuration, should be able to just have a QR or a single button to click that starts the test and knows everything
	- everything is stored to a csv file
		- failed devices aren't populated
	- Lots of manual processes
		- I have to copy out public keys and imei's and paste into new file
		- go to instance
		- creare a configuration for a device if it doesn't exist
		- use the above conf file and csv to provision the batch of devices
	- There is no dashboard for the factory to use, TB is not good enough
- We need something better than a CSV file
	- I think mongodb
		- We can have required keys, ie SN, manu date etc
		- Then an object that can change between devices and contains public key and other device/product specific options
- We need a central serive which allows us to view all of the devices we manufature via a web portal
	- THIs portal should allow
		- Webhook to send to customer
		- Export option for csv, excel etc
		- NOtes section to store notes on device?
		- API to pull out from dms instance
			- or possibly an option to push to an instance
	- The portal should also configure the device with where it points to?
- Binaries when built on ci/cd should be pushed to bintray or something, builds are tagged and an api on cloud that auto discovers only builds it can use with correct urls etc
- owners for each sections, 
	- i.e. factory sw is owned by:
		- Operations
		- Engineering Manager
		- HW Lead
		- SW LEad
	- cloud software is owned by
		- ENg Manager
		- SW Team lead
		- SW Team
		- devops/infrastructure
	- Firmware is owned by
		- PMO
		- ENgineering Manager
		- SW Team Lead(s)
		- Firmware team
	- CI/CD Infrastreuctr
		- SW TEam Lad
		- Validation Team
		- Devops
		- 
- Cloud changes
	- Need to move jenkins from digitalovean to aws
	- potentially move firmwave domain to aws?
	- Docker containers for everything? 
		- Use docker hub or aws ecr
	- portainer?
		- edge client?
	- Move to python 3
	- move to django 3 or 4
	- start to spin out the apps in the django framework we have
	- Fergal wants a cloud test platform...

## Things we need
- Branching strategy
- rules to only allow SM's when we have a flow diagram
- Platform IO
- Linux image
- single IDE
- place to store binaries
- docker
- aws monitoring on grafana/prometheus
- APN list file that matches IMSI prefix... common across all devices
- doxygen

## Cloud Thoughs 01/09/2022
- should have a single ingestion point for all devices, i,e. ingestion.taoglas.com 
	- MQTT, HTTPS etc
	- This is a simple server that is backed by a highly available database
	- Single write, multi read?
		- Read replicas
- We have a very thin layer
	- Sample ingestion
	- Hash
	- Conf
	- Report
	- Connection details
- Then webhooks and API access to everything else 
- Sinlge ingestion idea allows us to have a central product database alsoe(highly available)
- Factory devices get provisioned straight in there?
- Watched a video on [scaling Django](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCNj8mMoq38)
	- He talks about having apps for modules,
	- Don't have apps talking to each other via fucntion calls
	- use an RPC like gRPC, that way you can ru all apps locally, or... you can run them on a remote server, therefore you can scale horizontally
- I like the idea of having a section on the website to submit a jira ticket for support reasons
