# Quick Capture

- Don't respond immediately, write it down here...


## Thoughts on overall process in engineering
- As it stands we manufacture hardware in a factory in Shannon and it is often a  nightmare for many reasons
- EVT ssoftware is linux and requires too much configuration, should be able to just have a QR or a single button to click that starts the test and knows everything
- We need something better than a CSV file
	- I think mongodb
		- We can have required keys, ie SN, manu
- owners


## Things we need
- Branching strategy
- rules to only allow SM's when we have a flow diagram
- Platform IO
- Linux image
- single IDE
-
