## Attendees
- Padraig Skelly (Lvlogics)
- Niall Keating (Taoglas)
- Shane Bradley (Taoglas)
- Paul McGarrigle (Taoglas)


## Notes
- Lvlogics are using groups on the DMS to partition devices into units
	- When they create a group on the DMS, this name is not reflected on the dashboard, they have to find the *NULL* row in the lsit and then use the edit button to name it.
		- This would be streamlined for them if the asset could be named frmo thre DMS
