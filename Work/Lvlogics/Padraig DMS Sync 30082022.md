## Tasks
- [ ] Niall to send on documentation on how the nested structure of the org units structure works ‚è≥ 2022-09-02 üîΩ 

## Attendees
- Padraig Skelly (Lvlogics)
- Niall Keating (Taoglas)
- Shane Bradley (Taoglas)
- Paul McGarrigle (Taoglas)


## Notes
- Lvlogics are using groups on the DMS to partition devices into units
	- When they create a group on the DMS, this name is not reflected on the dashboard, they have to find the *NULL* row in the lsit and then use the edit button to name it.
		- This would be streamlined for them if the asset could be named frmo thre DMS
		- (NK) - This is Possible
	- I proposed using org units on the new site as this will save a significant amount of effort for us. 
- They often have multiple browser tabs open with multipls pages, i.e. device list/edit pages, groups, dashboard, rules etc
	- Would be very convientent if you could go to a devices strapping table and edit page from the dashbaord
		- (NK) - This is posssible

Org units
	ASM's 
		TC03 may have 6 different asms, can we limit what each asm can see within that org

Saving without a number in contacts

Need to review how notifications will owrk with templeates based on new page
