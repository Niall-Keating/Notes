- Niall Keating (Taoglas)

## Notes
- Messaging for MWC
	- Design services, probably not too much of a focus on IoT this time around.
- Cellular:
	- Chat with Martin Bell in Vodafone next Wednesday, Niall can't make it. 
	- MVNO's came about becuase big telco's didn't want thousands of small customers 
		- The just wanted big ones like Ryanair, GOvernemtn etc
	- Likes of AT&T own RAN and a core central network
		- Then MVNO's all interact with this
		- Kore Wireless then have their own internal core that sit's on top of this 
- MRC: Monthly Recurring Charge
- MVNO's have a wholesale agreement with the big telco's
